# life-planning-multiple-interests

A Claude Code skill for life planning and career direction when you have multiple interests and want to turn them into meaningful work.

## What This Skill Does

This skill helps you:
- Reframe "too many interests" as a superpower, not a weakness
- Find a "container" to integrate all your interests into meaningful work
- Build a personal operating system around your unique combination of skills
- Navigate career decisions when you're not sure which path to choose

## Core Framework

**Three Pillars of Personal Success:**
- Self-education (learning outside mainstream systems)
- Self-interest (following YOUR interests, not what others expect)
- Self-reliance (not outsourcing judgment to others)

**Growth Path for Generalists:**
1. Pursue YOUR goals (Brand)
2. Teach what you learn (Content)
3. Help others achieve faster (Product)
